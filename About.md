## WHY ?

I wanted a space to document my technical findings, as I work with customers and encounter shortfalls in documentation that could benefit further explanation.

## Whats SLiMann ?

SLiMann is a combination of my initials SLM and my colleague Rob Willmann's last name. When first joining VMware Rob mentored me and we quickly became close friends. Out of that friendship we teamed up to create our own lab, to further our knowledge in computing. Since then, I have carried forward our domain name with pride.

## Me

Born March 24 1983, I have always had computers in my life. Starting with a TRS-80 Model 4, then an Apple Macintosh II my parents used in their printing business. My first computer was a 133MHz AMD K5 based machine, my father had built for me. It ran Windows 3.1  and Wolfenstine 3D :)
